# Wingline
A 3rd person jet flying game.

I watched the new Topgun movie and was really inspired to make a jet game with dog fighting.

Eventually the project morphed into simply just a jet with semi-realistic physics, put into an arcade scenario.

This projects was really a benchmark of how I could optimize certain systems and graphics to deliver high framerates, even on weak systems.

In the process of this optimization, I became quite familiar with optimization techniques used in games along with Godot's low level graphics and physics apis.

After working aproximately 8 months on and off on this project, I stopped. I would however, like to keep working on it in the future, hence I will only upload some of the builds.

Here is a screenshot of some gameplay:
